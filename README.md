# Hello

This is a simple project which I've started

## Goals

Well, I'm not aiming for much, not on the visual aspect at least, this is a simple "brutalist" website on which I want to upload some poetry, it's just a side project that I hope to have fun with

## Done

Well, for now I think I did the base structure of how it'll look

## To Do

Well I think I'll need to build a backend mostly for uploading my poetry

> I should use MongoDB as a Document Database and probabbly apply some caching to this in the future
